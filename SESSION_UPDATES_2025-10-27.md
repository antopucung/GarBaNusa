# Session Updates - October 27, 2025

## Summary of Changes

This session implemented a comprehensive role-based hierarchy system and comparison functionality for the GarBaNusa Merit System platform.

---

## 1. Career GPS AI Integration ✅

**Issue:** Career GPS was not using user's actual training completion data.

**Fix:** Updated `career-recommender.ts` to:
- Fetch live user profile with training data
- Calculate gaps based on actual competencies
- Remove completed trainings from recommendations
- Update match percentage, timeline, and confidence based on real progress
- Show dynamic metrics that reflect training completion

**Impact:** Career GPS now provides personalized, data-driven recommendations that update as users complete trainings.

---

## 2. Role-Based Hierarchy System ✅

**Created 3 distinct user roles with proper organizational structure:**

### **Role 1: ASN (Staff) - 5 Users**
- Rina Sari (Analyst) - Merit: 76
- Ani Wijaya (Senior Analyst) - Merit: 82
- Ahmad Fauzi (Junior Analyst) - Merit: 72
- Sari Indah (Data Specialist) - Merit: 78
- Dewi Kusuma (Policy Analyst) - Merit: 80

**Dashboard:** `/dashboard`
**Features:**
- Personal merit tracking
- Training enrollment & progress
- Career GPS with AI recommendations
- View supervisor information

### **Role 2: Supervisor - 1 User**
- Budi Santoso (Division Head) - Merit: 88
- Manages 5 team members

**Dashboard:** `/supervisor-dashboard` (NEW)
**Features:**
- View all 5 team members ranked by merit
- Team statistics (average merit, top performer)
- Individual member profiles with competencies
- Training progress tracking
- Career progression monitoring
- Recommend for promotion functionality
- Send feedback to team members

### **Role 3: Committee - 1 User**
- Dr. Siti Nurhaliza (Committee Chair)

**Dashboard:** `/merit-board`
**Enhanced Features:**
- View all candidates (ASN + Supervisors + static)
- Filter by role:
  - All Candidates

## 3. Merit Board Enhancements ✅

### **Added Organizational Context**
- Shows "SUPERVISOR" badge for supervisors
- Displays reporting structure ("Reports to: [Name]")
- Shows team size for supervisors
- Displays team average merit
- Training completion counts

### **Fixed Supervisor Visibility**
**Issue:** Supervisors weren't appearing in Merit Board.

**Fix:** Updated `getCandidatesWithLiveData()` filter from:
```javascript
.filter(p => p.role === 'asn')
```
to:
```javascript
.filter(p => p.role === 'asn' || p.role === 'supervisor')
```

---

## 4. Candidate Comparison Feature ✅

**Implemented full side-by-side comparison functionality:**

### **Features:**
- Add up to 2 candidates to compare list
- Floating compare widget (bottom-center)
- "Add to Compare" / "Remove from Compare" toggle
- Compare list shows: "Rina Sari vs Budi Santoso (2/2)"
- "Compare Now" button opens full comparison modal

### **Comparison Modal Includes:**
- Side-by-side display (Blue vs Purple theme)
- Merit scores (large display)
- All metrics with progress bars:
  - Competency Match
  - Performance
  - 360° Feedback
  - Learning Agility
- Detailed competencies breakdown
- Reporting structure
- Team information (for supervisors)
- Training completion
- Tenure and NIP
- **AI Comparison Summary** with score differences

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/merit-board/page.tsx` - Added comparison state, handlers, and modal UI

---

## 5. User Data Uniqueness Fix ✅

**Issue:** All users were initialized with empty training arrays, losing their unique starting data.

**Fix:** Updated `initializeLiveDatabase()` in `user-profile-manager.ts`:
```javascript
trainingCompleted: user.trainingCompleted || []
certificationsEarned: user.certificationsEarned || []
```

**Impact:** Each user now maintains their unique:
- Competencies (different for each user)
- Merit scores (76, 82, 72, 78, 80, 88)
- Career progress levels
- Profile completeness

---

## 6. User Data Structure Updates ✅

**Updated `users.json` with:**
- 5 ASN staff members (user-001, user-004, user-005, user-006, user-007)
- 1 Supervisor (user-002) with team management capability
- 1 Committee member (user-003)
- Added `supervisorId` field linking ASN to their supervisor
- Added supervisor competencies and merit data
- Unique competency profiles for each user

---

## 7. Automatic Role-Based Routing ✅

**Updated dashboard routing:**
```javascript
if (user.role === 'supervisor') → '/supervisor-dashboard'
if (user.role === 'committee') → '/merit-board'
if (user.role === 'asn') → '/dashboard'
```

**Impact:** Users automatically land on their appropriate dashboard based on role.

---

## Technical Architecture

### **Database Structure**
- Centralized live database in `localStorage`
- Single source of truth for all merit data
- Real-time updates visible across all roles
- Each user maintains unique starting data

### **Data Flow**
```
ASN completes training
    ↓
Competencies updated
    ↓
Merit score recalculated
    ↓
Supervisor sees team update
    ↓
Committee sees candidate update
```

### **Key Functions**
- `initializeLiveDatabase()` - Sets up user data
- `getUserProfile()` - Fetch individual user
- `getAllUserProfiles()` - Fetch all users
- `getCandidatesWithLiveData()` - Get candidates for merit board
- `updateUserCompetencies()` - Update after training

---
